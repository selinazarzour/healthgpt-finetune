# 🩺 HealthGPT: A Fine-Tuned Medical Q&A Assistant

**HealthGPT** is a lightweight, domain-specific chatbot fine-tuned on medical question-answer pairs using the [TinyLLaMA-1.1B-Chat](https://huggingface.co/TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0) model. It answers medically-relevant questions with more accuracy and specificity than generic LLMs thanks to supervised fine-tuning on curated healthcare data.

> 💡 Built and fine-tuned by Selina Zarzour as an MVP to explore domain adaptation of LLMs in healthcare and radiology.

## 🔍 Demo

🚀 Run it locally with a GPU
💬 Ask anything from “What does a CT scan show in pneumonia?” to “Can antibiotics treat viral infections?”

## 🧠 Fine-Tuning Details

- **Base model**: `TinyLLaMA-1.1B-Chat`
- **Dataset**: 16,000+ Q&A pairs from [MedQuad](https://huggingface.co/datasets/keivalya/MedQuad-MedicalQnADataset)
- **Method**: PEFT with LoRA + 4-bit quantization via `bitsandbytes`
- **Tools**: `transformers`, `datasets`, `trl`, `gradio`, `peft`, `bitsandbytes`
